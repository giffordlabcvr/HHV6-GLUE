# HHV6-GLUE

## Description

This is HHV6-GLUE, a [GLUE](http://glue-tools.cvr.gla.ac.uk/) project designed to support
comparative genomic and evolutionary analysis of human herpesvirus 6 genomes.

HHV6-GLUE contains aligned, annotated genome sequence data for:

1. HHV6 isolates (via GenBank)
2. Endogenous viral elements (EVEs) derived from HHV6

## Sequence data

The sequence data in this project have been organised into the following sources:

*ncbi-refseqs*: Genome-length reference sequences of HHV6A and HHV6B (GenBank XML).

*ncbi-curated*: All HHV6 sequences in GenBank, except those used as references (GenBank XML).


## GLUE project

On computers with
[GLUE](http://glue-tools.cvr.gla.ac.uk/) installed, the HHV6-GLUE project can be instantiated by
navigating to the project folder, initiating GLUE, and issuing the following command in the GLUE shell:

	Mode path: /
	GLUE> run file hhv6Project.glue
