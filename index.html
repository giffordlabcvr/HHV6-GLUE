	  </h3>


	  <p>
		  "Human Herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) is a set of two closely related
		  <a target="_blank"  href="https://viralzone.expasy.org/16">betaherpesviruses</a>		  
		  known as HHV-6A and HHV-6B. 
		  Like the other herpesviruses, HHV-6  establishes life-long latency and can become reactivated later in life.
		  Reactivation can occur in the brain, lungs, heart, kidney and gastrointestinal tract, especially
		  in patients with immune deficiencies and transplant patients. In some cases,
		  HHV-6 reactivation in the brain tissue can cause cognitive dysfunction, permanent
		  disability and death.
	  </p>


	  <p>
		  Except in acute or initial infections, the viral DNA can
		  typically be found only by biopsy, as it does not circulate in peripheral blood.
		  There is an urgent need for new technologies to detect these occult infections that
		  are not apparent by standard quantitative PCR DNA testing methods, in order to prove
		  or disprove the important disease associations that have been suggested." --

	   <p>
		 <a target="_blank" href="http://glue-tools.cvr.gla.ac.uk/"><b>GLUE</b></a> is an open, integrated
		 software toolkit that provides functionality for storage and interpretation of
		 sequence data. 
	   </p>

	   <p>
		 <b>GLUE</b> supports the development of <b>“projects”</b> containing the data items
		 required for comparative genomic analysis 
		 (e.g.  sequences, multiple sequence alignments, genome feature annotations,
		 and other sequence-associated data). 
	   </p>

	   <p>
		 Projects are loaded into the <b>GLUE "engine"</b>, creating a relational database
		 that represents the semantic relationships between data items.
		 This provides a robust foundation for the implementation of <b>systematic
		 comparative analyses</b> and the development of <b>sequence-based resources</b>. 
	   </p>

	   <p>		 
		  The core schema of this database can be extended to accommodate
		  the idiosyncrasies of different projects, and
		  GLUE provides a scripting layer (based on JavaScript) for developing custom
		  analysis tools. 
	   </p>

	   <p>
		  Hosting of GLUE projects in an online version control system (e.g. GitHub) provides
		  a mechanism for their stable, collaborative development.
	   </p>
	   
	   

		   
		 <p>
		   Some examples of '<b>sequence-based resources</b>' built for viruses using GLUE include:

		 <ul>
		 		 
		   <li> 
			 <a target="_blank" href="http://cov-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk/"><b>COV-GLUE</b></a>: 
			 A GLUE resource for tracking genetic variation in SARS-COV2.
			 CoV-GLUE contains a database of amino acid replacements, insertions and
			 deletions which have been observed in GISAID hCoV-19 sequences sampled from the pandemic
		   </li>
		   <br>
		   
		   <li>
			 <a target="_blank" href="http://rabv-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk/"><b>RABV-GLUE</b></a>:
			 Tailored toward epidemiological tracking of rabies virus (RABV).
			 Includes a database of RABV sequences and metadata from NCBI, updated daily and arranged into major and minor clades, and
			 an analysis tool providing genotyping, analysis and visualisation of submitted FASTA sequences.
 		   </li>
 		   <br>
		   
		   <li>
			 <a target="_blank" href="http://hcv-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk/"><b>HCV-GLUE</b></a>:
			 This GLUE resource aims to support analysis of drug resistance and vaccine
			 escape in hepatitis C virus (HCV).
			 A database of HCV sequences and metadata from NCBI, updated daily and arranged
			 into clades (genotypes, subtypes). As well as pre-built multiple-sequence
			 alignments of NCBI sequences, it includes an analysis tool providing genotyping,
			 drug resistance analysis and visualisation of submitted FASTA sequences.

	   <a id="WhyGlueProject" class="anchor" href="#glueProject" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>What does building the HHV6-GLUE project offer?</strong>
	   </h3>
	   <hr>

		 
 
	   <p>
		 
		  HHV6-GLUE offers a number of advantages for performing comparative sequence
		  analysis of HHV6A and HHV6B:


		  <ol>

			<li> <strong>Reproducibility</strong>. 
			For many reasons, bioinformatics analyses are notoriously difficult to reproduce.
			The GLUE framework supports the implementation of fully reproducible 
			comparative genomics through the introduction of data standards and the use 
			of a relational database to capture the semantic links between data items.
			</li>
			<br>
		  
			<li> <strong>Reusable data objects and analysis logic</strong>. 
			For many - if not most - comparative genomic analyses, data preparation is nine
			tenths of the battle. The GLUE framework has been designed to ensure that 
			work spent preparing high-value data items such as multiple sequence alignments
			need only be performed once. Hosting of GLUE projects in an online version control 
			system such as GitHub allows for collaborative management of important data items
			and community testing of hypotheses.
			</li>
			<br>


			<li> <strong>Validation</strong>. 
			Building GLUE projects entails mapping the semantic links between data items
			(e.g. sequences, tabular data, multiple sequence alignments).
			This process provides an opportunity 
			for cross-validation, and thereby enforces a high level of data integrity.
			</li>
			<br>
		
			<li> <strong>Standardisation of the genomic co-ordinate space</strong>. GLUE
			projects allow all sequences to utilise the coordinate space of a chosen 
			reference sequence. Contingencies associated with insertions and deletions
			(indels) are handled in a systematic way.
			</li>
			<br>
		  
			<li> <strong>Predefined, fully annotated reference sequences</strong>:
			This project includes fully-annotated reference sequences for major lineages
			within the <i>Hepadnaviridae</i> family.
			</li>
			<br>
		  
			<li> <strong>Alignment trees</strong>:
			GLUE allows linking of alignments constructed at distinct taxonomic levels
			via an ""<b>alignment tree</b>"
			data structure. In the alignment tree, each alignment
			is constrained to a standard reference sequence, thus all multiple sequence
			alignments are linked to one another via a standardised coordinate system.
			</li>
			
		  </ol>
